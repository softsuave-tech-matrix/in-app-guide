# in-app-guide

A walkthrough guide that allows users to interactively explore all the features within your application.

## Overview

This JavaScript code provides a simple website tour functionality. The tour guides users through different elements on your website, explaining each step along the way.

## Usage

1. Include the JavaScript code in your project.
2. Set up the HTML elements for your tour steps.
3. Call the `initializeTour` function with the tour data to start the tour.

## Tour Data

The tour data is an array of objects, each representing a step in the tour. Each object has the following properties:

- `target`: The HTML element ID to highlight during the step.
- `title`: Title for the tour step.
- `description`: Description for the tour step.
- `position`: Position of the tooltip relative to the target element.

## Example

```javascript
// Example tour data
const userTourData = [
  {
    target: "element1",
    title: "Step 1: Introduction",
    description: "Welcome to our website! This is the first step of the tour.",
    position: "bottom-center",
  },
  // ... (other tour steps)
];

// Call the initializeTour function with the user-provided data
initializeTour(userTourData);
